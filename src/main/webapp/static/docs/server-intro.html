<div class="title"><span class="choice">Choicelet</span> Developer's Guide</div>
<div class="hdr">Introduction to the Server Environment</div>
<p>The underlying components of the <span class="choice">Choice</span>
server environment are Tomcat and MySQL. Tomcat is what is known as a
&ldquo;servlet container&rdquo;. It is open-source software from
Apache, written in Java, and runs in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
MySQL is an open-source relational database with which applications
running in Tomcat communicate, in order to access persistent storage.
In a conventional deployment of this architecture, server
applications would be written in Java and implemented as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servlet">servlets</a>
in Tomcat.</p>
<p><span class="choice">Choice</span> server
applications, however, are written in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)">Scala</a>
language, which is compiled to Java byte code, runs in a JVM, and can
interoperate with code written in Java. They run under a Scala server
framework called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(web_framework)">Lift</a>,
which runs on Tomcat. Lift provides many facilities for server
applications, including a mechanism called Mapper that is used to
persist run-time objects in the database. <span class="choice">Choice</span>
applications also use Lift's HTML template facility, which is known
as Snippets.</p>
<div class="hdr">Users, Groups, and Roles</div>
<p>The <span class="choice">Choice</span> server
infrastructure provides support for users and groups. A user may have
one or more roles with respect to a group, such as child, researcher,
or administrator, with each role providing different kinds of access
to the group. Users can be members of multiple groups, and the same
user account may even be associated with different usernames in
different groups. Usernames need only be unique within a single
group, so two users in different groups may have the same username.
Groups have a directed acyclic graph organization, but user
membership in groups is not transitive with respect to the graph.
That is, a user's membership in a group does not automatically confer
membership in either parent or child groups of that group.</p>
<p>This rather unusual organization of users and groups is intended
to support multiple researchers running multiple classroom
experiments, as well as possibly multiple web-based experiments. Each
group can have its own &ldquo;guest&rdquo; page, which is presented
to users who visit the group, but have not logged in. And each group
can have a &ldquo;home&rdquo; page, which is the starting page for
users who log in. A group name or group id can be specified as a URL
parameter when accessing the top-level page of the <span class="choice">Choice</span>
website. If a group so specified has a guest page, an HTTP redirect
will take the visitor to it.</p>
<p>If a group is being used for a particular experiment, subgroups of
that group may be created to represent different conditions or
treatments in the experiment. Each user may be assigned to subgroups,
in addition to their membership in the parent group. Client-side
applications have access to a user's list of group memberships, and
can use it to tailor their behavior.</p>
<p>Each group has controls that determine whether logins are allowed,
and whether users are allowed to self-register as group members.
These are normally disabled for a newly created group.</p>
<div class="hdr">Organization of Client Resources on the Server</div>
<p>The system for organizing client resources on the server is still
evolving. At this point in time, the main requirement is to support
multiple Choicelets, each composed of HTML, Javascript, and CSS
files, and with some sharing of code and other resources between
them. The current scheme is a top-level directory containing common
HTML files, with subdirectories, &ldquo;scripts&rdquo; and &ldquo;css&rdquo;,
for shared Javascript and CSS files. Within the shared &ldquo;scripts&rdquo;
directory, there are subdirectories, &ldquo;jquery&rdquo;, &ldquo;model&rdquo;,
and &ldquo;util&rdquo;, which contain respectively, jQuery and its
plugins, models for shared Choicelet widgets, and shared utility
code. Each Choicelet should have its own subdirectory under the top
level, with subdirectories such as &ldquo;scripts&rdquo; and &ldquo;css&rdquo;
for files that are specific to a given Choicelet. 
</p>
<p>Choicelet HTML files should be Lift templates that will be used to
generate the actual HTML for the client. Typically that means that
Choicelet HTML is wrapped in this way:</p>
<div class="code"><span class="tag">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;</span>
    <span class="tag">&lt;body <span class="attr">class</span>=<span class="string">&quot;lift:content_id=my_content&quot;</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="tag">&lt;div <span class="attr">class</span>=<span class="string">&quot;lift:surround?with=default;at=content&quot;</span> <span class="attr">id</span>=<span class="string">&quot;my_content&quot;</span>&gt;</span>
            <span class="tag">&lt;head_merge&gt;</span>
            ...code that would normally be in the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; section...
            <span class="tag">&lt;/head_merge&gt;</span>
            ...Choicelet body HTML...
        <span class="tag">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span class="tag">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;/html&gt;</span></div>
<p>Essentially the content within the
&ldquo;my_content&rdquo; &lt;div&gt; is wrapped by some standard
Choicelet HTML from a shared file named &ldquo;default.html&rdquo;.
However, content within the &lt;head_merge&gt; section is merged into
the head of the resulting HTML document. So any Choicelet-specific
Javascript or CSS references should be placed there. Code outside the
&ldquo;my_content&rdquo; &lt;div&gt; is discarded, but it is useful
to make the Choicelet HTML file look more like a normal HTML file for
validation purposes.</p>
<div class="hdr">Use of require.js, jQuery, and Shared Javascript</div>
<p>Choicelets are expected to organize Javascript code into modules,
and actualize them through the use of <a HREF="http://requirejs.org/">require.js</a>.
To make this easier, the &ldquo;default.html&rdquo; file that wraps
Choicelet HTML includes a reference to require.js. The base jQuery
framework is also included this way. A Javascript module can be
defined with require.js like this:</p>
<div class="code">
define([<span class="string">'jquery'</span>, <span class="string">'dependencyA'</span>, <span class="string">'dependencyB'</span>], <span class="keyword">function</span>($, depA, depB) {
    ...module code...
    <span class="keyword">return</span> moduleHandle;
});
</div>
<p>Here we have a module that uses jQuery and two other modules,
&ldquo;dependencyA&rdquo; and &ldquo;dependencyB&rdquo;. Require.js
dynamically loads these dependencies and then calls the function
argument of the define statement, passing it the module handles of
each of the dependencies. This function returns the module handle for
the current module. A module handle can be anything that provides the
necessary access to a module. If a module consists of a library of
functions, the module handle might be an object containing named
references to each of the functions. If the module defines a type of
object, the module handle might be the constructor for that object.
In other cases, the module handle might be a function.</p>
<p>At the top level of a Choicelet, there would typically be some
Javascript code using require.js to invoke an initial Javascript
function.  It might look like this:</p>
<div class="code">
require([<span class="string">'jquery'</span>, <span class="string">'lightlet'</span>], <span class="keyword">function</span>($, lightlet) {
    $(<span class="keyword">function</span>() { lightlet.run(); });
});
</div>
<p>Here it is assumed that the &ldquo;lightlet&rdquo; module returns
an object which contains a &ldquo;run&rdquo; function as its module
handle. Notice that the call to run() is wrapped in jQuery's $(), so
that it doesn't happen until the DOM is ready.</p>
<p>Another thing that a top-level Choicelet script might do is to
define paths to other Javascript modules. Suppose that a Choicelet,
lightlet, had a number of Javascript modules in its &ldquo;scripts&rdquo;
subdirectory. It could configure require.js using:</p>
<div class="code">
require.config({
    paths: {
        lightlet: <span class="string">'lightlet/scripts'</span>
    }
});
</div>
<p>Then a file, &ldquo;lightlet.js&rdquo; in &ldquo;lightlet/scripts/&rdquo;
could be referenced as &ldquo;lightlet/lightlet&rdquo; in a
require.js dependency list. Require.js maps the &ldquo;lightlet&rdquo;
module prefix to the path, &ldquo;lightlet/scripts/&rdquo;. Note that
&ldquo;.js&rdquo; is left off of module references, and this
indicates to require.js that a module is expected. However,
require.js will also load un-modularized .js files this way, but
their module handles are likely to be undefined. When defining paths
or referencing other Choicelet files, note that &ldquo;default.html&rdquo;
sets a &lt;base&gt; in the HTML it generates, and it references the
top level of the <span class="choice">Choice</span>
website. So HTML files in a Choicelet subdirectory do not have a
default base of that subdirectory, but rather an explicit base of the
top level. 
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;default.html&rdquo; file defines several require.js
module prefixes. Modules in the top-level &ldquo;scripts&rdquo;
directory can be referenced using the prefix, &ldquo;core&rdquo;. The
&ldquo;jquery&rdquo; prefix refers to the top-level &ldquo;scripts/jquery/&rdquo;
directory, which contains many jQuery plugins, including the jQuery
UI plugin. They can be referenced as &ldquo;jquery/jquery.pluginname&rdquo;.
But the base jQuery is just &ldquo;jquery&rdquo;. It also defines a
module prefix, &ldquo;model&rdquo;, to reference Javascript models
for shared components. And it defines a prefix, &ldquo;util&rdquo;,
to reference utility libraries and objects, including a random number
generator, &ldquo;alea&rdquo;, and a module that defines a data type
for a color. The require.config() operation is cumulative for path
definitions, so a Choicelet need only define any additional prefixes
it requires.</p>
<div class="hdr">Support for Sessions</div>
<p>A <span class="choice">Choice</span> client
communicates with the server in the context of a session. The session
is typically established with the first access to a page on the
<span class="choice">Choice</span> website, before
the user is logged in. Once the user is logged in, the session tracks
the username, group memberships, and roles associated with that user.
Accesses to session-enabled pages are recorded with timestamps in the
database. Choicelets and quizzes are session-enabled by including the
&ldquo;core/choice-session&rdquo; module as a dependency. As a jQuery
plugin, its functions can be called using $.session('fnname', args).
It self-initializes through a jQuery page-ready callback, performing
a &ldquo;getSession&rdquo; operation with the server. In response to
&ldquo;getSession&rdquo;, the server creates a new session if one
does not already exist, and returns information about the current
user if the user is logged in. Clients can wait for this information
to be available using $.session('onReady', fn), and retrieve it using
various other functions of the $.session() plugin.</p>
<div class="hdr">$.session() API</div>
<div class="code">
$.session(<span class="string">'getSession'</span>, doneFn)

<div class="annot">This performs the &ldquo;getSession&rdquo; operation with the server. When the server's response
is received, it is passed as an object to the function specified by doneFn. Then
it is also passed to any callbacks that were previously registered using
$.session('onReady', fn). The format of the object is:</div>
<div class="code">
{
    sessionid: {String} a unique session identifier for this session
    redirect: {String} URL for redirect, if any
    cgid: {Int} current group id
    user: {
        name: {String} login username
    }
    groups: {Array} [
        {
            gid: {Int} group id
            name: {String} group name
            desc: {String} group description
            member: {String} username in group, if user is a member
            paths: {Array{String}} path names of the group
            roles: {Array{String}} roles of user for the group
        }, ...
    ]
}</div>
<div class="annot">The 'redirect' field is present if the user should be directed to a different page.
This usually happens when a user who is not logged in accesses a page that requires
a login. The $.session plugin handles any redirect for the 'getSession' operation
that it performs during initialization.
<p>The 'cgid' field is present whether the user is logged in or not, and reflects either
the group parameter on the page URL, or the id of the default group, &ldquo;/&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The 'user' field contains an object which currently contains just the login username.
It is present only if the user is logged in.</p>
<p>The 'groups' field contains an array of objects, containing one object for each
group for which the user holds at least one role. It is present only if the user
is logged in. The fields in this object are:</p></div>

<div class="code">'gid' - the unique integer group id of the group.

'name'   - the short name of the group, which distinguishes it from other
           subgroups of its parent group(s).

'desc'   - a short description of the group.

'member' - the user's username in the group, but only if the user is a
           member of the group. A user may have roles for a group without
           being a member.

'paths'  - an array of all of the path names for the group. Because groups
           are organized as a directed acyclic graph, a group may have multiple
           parents, and multiple pathnames that uniquely identify it. However,
           each pathname will end with the short name of the group.

'roles'  - an array of role names held by the user with respect to the group.
           The currently defined roles are:

    GUEST      - a role normally assigned to users who are not logged in.
    CHILD      - usually a research subject
    SUPERVISOR - a teacher or other activity supervisor
    ASSOCIATE  - an associate researcher, with limited access to experimental
		         data
    PRIMARY    - a primary researcher, with full access to experimental data
    ADMIN      - an administrator</div>

$.session('<span class="string">onReady</span>', readyFn)

<div class="annot">The function specified by 'readyFn' is called with the session information
object as soon as a $.session('getSession') operation has fetched it from
the server. If the session information is already available, 'readyFn' is
called immediately.</div>

$.session('<span class="string">getSessionId</span>') returns the session id for this session

$.session('<span class="string">getContextRoot</span>')

<div class="annot">Returns the context root of the <span class="choice">Choice</span> website. This can be used to form
URLs to reference pages, starting from the top level of the website.</div>

$.session('<span class="string">getCurrentGroup</span>')

<div class="annot">This returns the group information for the user's current group. It is
valid only if the user is logged in.</div>

$.session('<span class="string">getGroups</span>')

<div class="annot">This returns the array of group information objects for the current user.
It is valid only if the user is logged in.</div>

$.session('<span class="string">getUser</span>')

<div class="annot">This returns the user information object for the currently logged in
user. As noted above, the 'name' field of this object contains the
username of the user in the current group.</div>

$.session('<span class="string">getPageName</span>')

<div class="annot">This returns just the page name from the URL of the current page.
It is the last path component of the URL, with any suffix, such as
&ldquo;.html&rdquo;, removed. Pages named &ldquo;index.html&rdquo; may be accessed without
specifying &ldquo;index.html&rdquo;, in which case the page name will be an
empty string.</div>

$.session('<span class="string">queue</span>', fn)

<div class="annot">Operations to the server often need to happen sequentially, rather
	than in parallel. This function provides a way to queue server
	operations for execution after all previously queue operations have
	completed. It is mostly used internally.</div>

$.session('<span class="string">queuedRedirect</span>', url)

<div class="annot">This queues a redirect to a specified URL, to be performed after
	other server operations have completed. This function attempts to
	ensure that even operations queued after it are completed before
	the redirect is executed, since the redirect will clear the queue.</div>

$.session('<span class="string">logoutUser</span>', resultFn)

<div class="annot">Logout the current user, and call the function specified by 'resultFn'
	when the server has confirmed the logout. The current session also
	will be terminated.</div>

$.session('<span class="string">extend</span>', extensions)

<div class="annot">Extend the $.session plugin with additional methods, specified in
	the 'extensions' object. This is used by the 'login' module to
	add methods for login and user registration.</div>
</div>
<div class="hdr">Model, View, Controller Support</div>
<p>Choicelet client code should be organized according to a Model,
View, Controller (MVC) architecture. In particular, the separation of
the Choicelet model as a separate component that does not reference
the DOM is central to the data collection strategy. When an
experimental subject uses a Choicelet, top-level actions on the model
component are automatically captured, timestamped, and logged on the
server. Meanwhile, a view component of the Choicelet listens for
changes in the model, and updates the DOM to show the current state.
The controller component of the Choicelet listens for DOM events,
which usually indicate user actions, and initiates corresponding
actions on the model component.</p>
<p>Actions on a model may cause it to initiate other actions on
itself or other sub-models. These actions are considered to be
consequences of the top-level actions, which will occur every time
the same sequence of top-level actions is executed against the newly
initialized model. So they are not logged on the server. But a
Choicelet view component may listen for them, if they are relevant to
updating the view. A model may also declare &ldquo;events&rdquo; when
processing an action. Events are essentially null actions. They are
not logged, but a view can listen for them.</p>
<p>When a user reloads a Choicelet page, the initial state of the
model is restored from the server, and any top-level actions that
were logged for the model are played back at maximum speed. This
normally results in the page being restored to the state it was in at
the time of the reload.</p>
<p>As it is envisioned, extraction of experimental data will be
implemented as an alternate view component on the Choicelet model.
This component will observe the model as it is updated according to
the previously logged actions of users. It need not interact with the
DOM at all, but rather will use other <span class="choice">Choice</span>
infrastructure to save the data it collects. If necessary, the model
component can be enhanced after the experiment with additional events
that are useful for data collection, as long as the behavior of the
model is unchanged.</p>
<p>It is also anticipated that there will be a generic playback
controller component for Choicelets, which will enable researchers to
watch a user's interaction with the Choicelet, at normal or
accelerated speed. In this configuration, the Choicelet's normal view
component should do the actual display.</p>
<div class="hdr">ChoiceModel API</div>
<p>The ChoiceModel API is
provided by the 'core/modelLib' module. Its module handle is an
object containing constructors for ChoiceModel and ChoiceTimer, so it
looks like this:</p>
<div class="code">
{
    ChoiceModel: ChoiceModel,
    ChoiceTimer: ChoiceTimer
}
</div>
<p>So a Choicelet model could include
modelLib as a dependency and use it like this:</p>
<div class="code">
define([<span class="string">'core/modelLib'</span>], <span class="keyword">function</span>(modelLib) {
    var ChoiceModel = modelLib.ChoiceModel,
        ChoiceTimer = modelLib.ChoiceTimer;
    <div class="annot">...model code...</div>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> ColorMixer;
});
</div>
<p>Here the model returns a module handle
that is its constructor. We will use the ColorMixer model to
illustrate the API.</p>
<p>Choicelet models are approximately
subclasses of ChoiceModel. For ColorMixer, this is accomplished by:</p>
<div class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> ColorMixer(palette) {
    <span class="attr">this</span>.initModel(<span class="string">'cmixer'</span> + ColorMixer.nextId(), arguments);
    <span class="attr">this</span>.palette = palette;
    <span class="attr">this</span>.reset();
}
	
ColorMixer.nextId = ChoiceModel.idMaker();

ChoiceModel.define(<span class="string">'ColorMixer'</span>, <span class="string">'0.5'</span>, ColorMixer);
</div>
<p>First, the constructor for a ColorMixer model is defined. Inside the
constructor, the first call is to initModel(), a method that
ColorMixer inherits from ChoiceModel:</p>
<div class="code">
<span class="attr">this</span>.initModel(instanceName, arguments)

instanceName - {String} the name of a particular instance of the model.
A common way to generate instance names is to append a unique id to a
string that identifies the model type.

arguments - literally, the Javascript arguments variable.
</div>
<p>This creates an association between the specified instance name and the
model instance that is being initialized by the constructor. When recorded
actions are retrieved from the server, they reference models by their
instance names.</p>
<p>ChoiceModel provides a function that
returns a function to generate sequential integer ids. This line is
using that function to define the nextId() function that is used in
the model constructor:</p>
<div class="code">
ColorMixer.nextId = ChoiceModel.idMaker();
</div>
<p>Note that it is actually calling idMaker(), not just inheriting it.
Each time idMaker() is called, it returns a new id generator
function, which starts generating ids from one.</p>
<p>This line actually performs the
inheritance of ColorMixer from ChoiceModel:</p>
<div class="code">
ChoiceModel.define(<span class="string">'ColorMixer'</span>, <span class="string">'0.5'</span>, ColorMixer);

ChoiceModel.define(modelName, modelVersion, modelConstructor)

modelName - {String} the name of the model, which is normally the name of
its constructor.

modelVersion - {String} a version identifier of the model.

ModelConstructor - {function} the model constructor function

The modelName and modelVersion are saved as properties of the modelConstructor,
'NAME' and 'VERSION', respectively. Methods from ChoiceModel are copied into
the modelConstructor.prototype object, so that they will be inherited by
any instances of the model.
</div>
<p>Note again that
ChoiceModel.define() is being called during the definition of the
model, not during creation of an instance.</p>
<p>Next, the
actions supported by the model are defined:</p>
<div class="code">
ColorMixer.defAction(<span class="string">'reset'</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>() {
<span class="annot">...code for the reset action...</span>
});

ColorMixer.defAction(<span class="string">'setTarget'</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>(color) {
<span class="annot">...code for the setTarget action...</span>
});

ColorMixer.defAction(<span class="string">'select'</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>(color) {
<span class="annot">...code for the select action...</span>
});

ColorMixer.defAction(<span class="string">'unselect'</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>(color) {
<span class="annot">...code for the unselect action...</span>
});

ColorMixer.defAction(<span class="string">'mix'</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>() {
<span class="annot">...code for the mix action...</span>
});

ModelConstructor.defAction(actionName, actionFn)

actionName &ndash; {String} the name by which the action will be invoked
and recorded.

ActionFn &ndash; {function} the action function. It may have any number
of arguments, including a variable number. But its arguments usually
should be simple data types such as strings and numbers.

DefAction adds a function with the specified actionName to the
ModelConstructor prototype object. However, that function is not
actionFn, but a function which wraps actionFn with some infrastructure
code for logging actions and notifying action listeners when an action
is invoked.</div>
<p>A model may also
define events:</p>
<div class="code">ColorMixer.defEvent(<span class="string">'dirtyYellow'</span>);</div>
<p>This creates a
method dirtyYellow() on ColorMixer, which does nothing with the state
of the model. But clients of the model can listen for 'dirtyYellow',
and the model or its clients may call dirtyYellow() on an instance of
the model, to declare that the event has happened. Events may also
have arguments, and these are passed to listeners when the event is
declared. Events are never logged to the server.</p>
<p>A model can also
define ordinary methods, but such methods should not change the state
of the model. They would be used mainly to query the internal state
of the model. For example:</p>
<div class="code">ColorMixer.prototype.isCorrect = <span class="keyword">function</span>() {
    <span class="keyword">if</span> ((<span class="keyword">this</span>.target === <span class="keyword">undefined</span>) || (<span class="keyword">this</span>.result === <span class="keyword">undefined</span>)) {
        <span class="keyword">throw</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> Error(<span class="string>">'color mixer is not in a compatible state'</span>);
    }
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">this</span>.target === <span class="keyword">this</span>.result;
};</div>
<p>This
function checks whether the result of a mix() action matches the
target color.</p>
<p>This
completes the description of what is needed to define a model. Keep
in mind that models should not interact with the DOM, so they rarely
need jQuery as a dependency.</p>
<p>A
model inherits several functions from ChoiceModel that are used by
clients of the model:</p>
<div class="code">
listen(actionName, listenFn)

actionName - {String} an action or event name for the model.

listenFn - {function} a function to be called when the action or
           event happens. The function is called after an action
           is executed, and is passed the result value, if any,
           from the action, along with the original arguments of
           the action (or event). The argument list is:
<div class="code">
(model, action, result, args)

model  - {Object} the model instance.
action - {String} the action or event name. The name may be
         namespaced, similarly to jQuery events.
result - the result returned by the action. Not present for
         an event.
args   - the original arguments of the action or event.
</div>

unlisten(actionName)

actionName- {String} an action or event name for the model.</div>
<p>The listen() and
unlisten() methods of a model provide its clients with a way to
observe actions and events on the model. As with jQuery events, a
namespace suffix can be attached to the action or event name,
separated by a period. This mainly provides a way to distinguish
multiple listeners on a model when unlisten() is called. If
namespaces are not used, unlisten() will remove all listeners for the
specified action or event. It is also possible to call
unlisten('.namespace') to remove all listeners for the specified
namespace.</p>
<div class="hdr">Using a Model</div>
<p>In simplest terms, the way to use a model is to create an instance of it using
its constructor and the Javascript <span class="keyword">new</span> operator.
Then a view component can use the instance's listen() function to listen
for actions or events, and update a display (or collect data). A controller
component can invoke actions on the model instance, based on user interaction.</p>
<p>However, for the top-level model, things are slightly more complicated.
The top-level model is associated with a <i>state stream</i> on the server.
The state stream is created when the instance of the top-level model is
created. It records the arguments to the constructor of the top-level instance.
As long as the state stream remains open, top-level actions on any model
instances are saved in the stream. If the user reloads the page, and a state
stream is open, the top-level model instance will be recreated from data in
the stream, and saved actions will be played back against it. This should restore
the page to its state prior to the reload.</p>
<p>Model instances inherit a close() function from ChoiceModel:</p>
<div class="code">
<span class="keyword">this</span>.close(doneFn)

where <span class="keyword">this</span> is the model instance.

doneFn - {function} a function that is called when the close is
         completed.
</div>
<p>This will close the state stream and call doneFn, if called on the top-level model
instance. For other model instances, it simply calls doneFn. Generally it should
be called only on the top-level model instance, when the Choicelet is finished.</p>
<p>The top-level model instance is created indirectly, using a function in the
'core/choice-control' module. It is:</p>
<div class="code">
$.control(<span class="string">'getState'</span>, constructor, startFn, ...)

constructor - {function} the top-level model constructor
startFn     - {function} called with the model instance as its argument,
              once the model instance has been created
...         - arguments for the model constructor, if any
</div>
<p>The 'core/choice-control' module is a jQuery plugin, with its methods accessed
via $.control(). It should be listed as a dependency of the module which creates
the top-level model, which is generally not the module that implements the
top-level model.</p>
<p>The operation of getState depends on whether a state stream is currently open
for the session. If no state stream is open, it uses the model constructor to
create an instance of the top-level model. It opens a new state stream and saves
the constructor arguments to it. Then it calls the startFn, passing it the
model instance as an argument.</p>
<p>If a state stream is open, getState reconstructs the top-level model instance
from the previously saved constructor arguments, and passes it to startFn as before.
But when startFn returns, it also plays back any saved actions in the state stream,
restoring the model state to its previous glory.</p>
<p>In both cases, the startFn generally will initialize the view and controller
components of the Choicelet. But if startFn or the controller also perform some
initial action on the model, to initialize it for example, it needs to avoid
doing this when the state stream already exists. That's because that initial
action would have been saved in the stream, and will be replayed against the
model when startFn returns.</p>
<p>The choice-control plugin provides methods to test for the different modes of
operation:</p>
<div class="code">
$.control(<span class="string">'isModeNormal'</span>)
<div class="annot">
Returns <span class="keyword">true</span> if the current mode of operation is
normal. Generally that means that actions on the model are happening as a
result of real-time interaction with a user, as opposed to actions that are
being played back from a state stream.
</div>
$.control(<span class="string">'isModeReload'</span>)
<div class="annot">
Returns <span class="keyword">true</span> if the current mode of operation is
reload. In this mode, actions from a state stream are being played back
against the model, in order to restore it to a previous state.
</div>
$.control(<span class="string">'isModePlayback'</span>)
<div class="annot">
Returns <span class="keyword">true</span> if the current mode of operation is
playback. This means that actions from a saved state stream are being played
back against the model, but at a rate dependent on their timestamps. This
would be used by a researcher to view a user's interaction with a Choicelet,
at either normal or a higher speed.
</div>
</div>
<p>There are a number of other choice-control methods:</p>
<div class="code">
$.control(<span class="string">'closeState'</span>, doneFn)

    doneFn - {function} a function to be called after the server has
    		 responded to the close operation.

<div class="annot">
This closes the state stream, if any, for the current session. Then it calls
the doneFn.
</div>
$.control(<span class="string">'getMode'</span>)

	Return the current mode: 'normal', 'reload', or 'playback'
	
$.control(<span class="string">'getTime'</span>)

    Return the current time, in milliseconds.

<div class="annot">
For normal mode, this is the actual current time. For reload mode, it
is the timestamp of the most recent saved action to be played back.
For playback mode, it is an estimate of the current time, based on the
last action, and the speed of the playback.
</div>
$.control(<span class="string">'alert'</span>, ...)

    ... - string arguments to be concatenated and passed to either the
          real alert() function, or to console.log().

<div class="annot">
This performs the same function as the normal Javascript alert() function
if the current mode is normal. Otherwise it just writes the alert message
using console.log().
</div>
$.control(<span class="string">'defer'</span>, deferFn, deferThis)

deferFn - a function to be called after a delay of 0 milliseconds
deferThis - the <span class="keyword">this</span> pointer for deferFn

<div class="annot">
Sometimes it seems you just need to do something after a zero-length
timeout. This function does that, along with some of the functionality
of jQuery's $.proxy() function.
</div>
$.control(<span class="string">'delay'</span>, delayFn, msec)

delayFn - a function called after a timeout of msec milliseconds
msec    - timeout in milliseconds

<div class="annot">
This is essentially the Javascript setTimeout() function, except that
it calls the delayFn immediately if animation is disabled.
</div>
$.control(<span class="string">'animation'</span>, enable, speedup)

enable  - {boolean} <span class="keyword">true</span> if animation should
          be enabled, or <span class="keyword">false</span> otherwise.
speedup - {int} ]a multiplier for the speed of animation. Normal speed
          is the default, which is a value of one.

<div class="annot">
This controls whether animation is enabled, and at what speed. Animation
is normally disabled during reload mode, and is disabled when choice-control
initializes.
