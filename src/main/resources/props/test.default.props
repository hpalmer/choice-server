# This is the JNDI name used to access the SQL database used by the server. The
# database is configured in the context.xml file.
default.jndi.name=jdbc/choice

## Facebook login configuration

# The server at one time supported login using Facebook credentials. This feature
# has not been used or maintained, but the code is still there.
#facebook.secret=<secret for Facebook login>

## Google login configuration

# Login and user registration using Google credentials is supported. To enable that,
# a client id and secret must be obtained from Google and entered here. And the
# appropriate attributes must be set on the user group.
#google.client.id=<client id for Google login>
#google.client.secret=<client secret for Google login>

## Mailer configuration

# The server is capable of sending email, for example as part of a user registration
# or password reset process. These properties configure the default system mailer
# object, though other mailer objects can be created. A typical configuration is
# to use a mail relay agent, such as postfix, on the local system, which makes the
# connection to the SMTP server. But a direct SMTP server connection also can be
# configured.
mailer.system.host=localhost
mailer.system.port=25
mailer.system.auth=false
mailer.system.starttls=false
# Supply these if auth=true:
# mailer.system.username=username
# mailer.system.password=password

## Host places accessed by the server

# Folder to contain Choice filesystem data files
choice.HostDataFolder=${catalina.base}/ChoiceData

# Alternate location of configuration files
choice.ConfigFolder=${choice.ConfigFolder}

## Server tuning parameters

# Maximum number of VNodes cached by DbManager
choice.VNodeCacheLimit=500

# Maximum number of FsName entries cached by DbManager
choice.FsNameCacheLimit=1000
