    <h1>Lua Scripting in FSChoice</h1>
    <p>
        FSChoice supports the execution of Lua scripts on the server, where the
        Lua scripts are stored in the FSChoice filesystem as files of MIME type,
        “text/x-lua”, which is the default MIME type for files with an extension
        of “.lua”.
    </p>
    <h2 class="western">Client Interface for Lua Script Execution</h2>
    <p>
        A Lua script stored in the FSChoice filesystem can be executed via an
        Ajax operation from the client. Arguments for the script are transmitted
        to the server using JSON encoding, where they are deserialized into Lua
        values and passed to the script. Return value(s) of the script are
        serialized to JSON and returned to the client. The operation is invoked by
        an HTTP POST with a JSON-encoded body containing:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        <strong>op</strong> – “lua”, the operation code<br>
        <strong>path</strong> – the file path of the Lua script to be executed<br>
        <strong>args</strong> – an optional array containing the arguments for the script<br>
        <strong>asOwner</strong> – an optional boolean with <em><span style="font-weight: normal">true</span></em>
        indicating a request that the script be run as the owner of the script
        instead of the user associated with the current session
    </p>
    <p>The POST URL normally takes the form: http://<em>host</em>:<em>port</em>/fschoice/?api=file.</p>
    <p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
        The /scripts/fileops.js file provides a function to invoke a Lua script
        and return a promise for the result. fileops.js extends jQuery, so that
        the call takes the form:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        <em>promise</em> = <strong>$.file</strong>('lua', <em>reqobj</em>, <em>options</em>)
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>reqobj</em> contains the <strong>path</strong> and any <strong>args</strong> and
        <strong>asOwner</strong>
        fields for the request. The <em>options</em> argument can be used to set
        Ajax options supported by jQuery.
    </p>
    <p>
        The response object returned from the Ajax operation contains the following fields:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">status</span>
        - a code of 1 if successful, otherwise a negative value and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">msg</span>
        field should be present<br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">msg</span> - an error message if <span style="font-weight: bold;">status</span>
        is negative<br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">result</span> - the return value of the Lua script if no error
    </p>
    <h2 class="western">Access Control and Lua Scripts</h2>
    <p>
        The execution of a Lua script file is controlled by two specific access rights:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        <strong>run_script</strong>
        – this right allows the principal to execute the script as itself, where
        the principal is normally the user associated with the current session<br>
      <strong>run_as_owner</strong> – this right allows the principal to execute
      the script as the owner of the script file
    </p>
    <p>
        If the <strong>asOwner</strong>
        parameter is false or not present in the request to execute a Lua
        script, the <strong>run_script</strong>
        access right to the script file is required, and the principal used
        for any file operations performed by the script is the user
        associated with the session making the request. If <strong>asOwner</strong>
        is <em>true</em>,
        the <strong>run_as_owner</strong>
        access right to the script file is required, and the principal used
        for any file operations performed by the script is the owner of the
        script file itself. The right to read a Lua script file is neither required nor
        conveyed by
        the <strong>run_script</strong> and <strong>run_as_owner</strong> rights. These only allow
        the script to be executed. However, navigating a file path to a Lua script
        requires additional rights for the folders traversed on the path,
        typically <strong>list_folder</strong>, but any of <strong>add_folder_member</strong>, <strong>replace_folder_member</strong>,
        or <strong>remove_folder_member</strong> implies the <strong>list_folder</strong> right. Note that all file
        operations requested by a
        Lua script are subject to
        FSChoice access control.
    </p>
    <h1>FSChoice APIs for Lua Scripts</h1>
    <h2 class="western">File Operations</h2>
    <p>These operations are included in the Lua filelib module.</p>
    <h3 class="western">lookup(path|id) – get information about a file specified
      by its file path or file id</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in; margin-bottom: 0">
        This operation returns
      basic metadata associated with a file, where the file can be specified by
      a string containing the file path, or by the file's unique numeric id. The
      metadata may vary somewhat with the type of file referenced, but generally
      the following keys are present in the returned table:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in; margin-bottom: 0">
        <strong>mimetype</strong> – the MIME type of the file<br>
        <strong>name</strong> – the simple name of the file within its folder<br>
        <strong>path</strong> – the full file path<br>
        <strong>id</strong> – the unique numeric file id of this file<br>
        <strong>size</strong> – the size of the file in bytes<br>
        <strong>container</strong> – a boolean indicating whether the file is a type of folder<br>
        <strong>paths</strong> – an array-like table containing all the file paths which reference this file<br>
        <strong>mtime</strong> – the file modification timestamp, as milliseconds since the epoch<br>
        <strong>crtime</strong> – the file creation timestamp, as milliseconds since the epoch<br>
        <strong>owner</strong> – the full file path of the user or group who owns the file<br>
        <strong>ownerId</strong> – the file id corresponding to the owner user or group file<br>
        <strong>refcount</strong> – count of the number of links to the file<br>
        <strong>special</strong> – a boolean indicating whether the file is “special”, typically that FSChoice has a dedicated
        handler for its MIME type
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        lookup returns a table if successful. If an
      error occurs, it returns <em>nil</em> as the first return value, and an
      error message string as the second return value.
    </p>
    <h3 class="western">list(path [, mimetype]) – list the files in a folder or
      folder-like file</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
      This operation lists the files in a folder or
      folder-like file (such as a user group). A MIME type may be specified to
      list only member files of that MIME type. It returns an array-like table
      containing lookup information for each member file. The table contains
      entries for “.” and “..”, which correspond to the specified folder and its
      parent folder. The “.” and “..” entries are not subject to the MIME type
      filter.
    </p>
    <h3 class="western">mkdir(path [, recursive]) – create a folder, optionally
      including its ancestors</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        This creates a new folder with the specified
        file path. If <em>recursive</em> is specified as <em>true</em>, any folders which do not already exist in
        the given path are also created. If <em>recursive</em> is <em>false</em> or
        unspecified, then all
        the components of the file path except the last must already exist. If
        the operation is successful, a table is returned containing lookup
        information for the new folder, and a field, <strong>status</strong>=1. If an
        error occurs, the first return value is <em>nil</em>, and the
        second return value is an error message string.
    </p>
    <h3 class="western">rm(path [, recursive]) – remove a file, optionally
      including its descendants</h3>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        This removes a link to a file at the
        specified file path. If it is the last link to the file, then the file
        itself is deleted. If the file is a folder or folder-like file, it must be
        empty, unless <em>recursive</em> is
        specified as <em>true</em>. If the link being removed is the last
        link to a folder, and <em>recursive</em> is
        <em>true</em>,
        the operation is applied recursively to the members of the folder
        before the folder itself is deleted. However, when multiple links to a
        folder exist, and this operation is applied to one of them, <em>recursive</em> is ignored,
        since the folder will continue
        to exist and be accessible through at least one other link. This
        operation returns a boolean value of <em>true</em> if it
        is successful and results in the deletion of a file. It returns <em>false</em> if it is successful,
        but other links to the
        same file remain. If an error occurs, the first return value is <em>nil</em>, and the
        second return value is an error message string.
    </p>

    <h3 class="western">writejson(path, value) – serialize a Lua value or table
      to JSON and write it to a file</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        This serializes a given Lua value or table to
        JSON and writes it to a specified file as a file with MIME type,
        “application/json”. If the file does not already exist, it is created. If
        the file does exist and has the MIME type, “application/json”, it is
        overwritten with the new JSON data. An error occurs if the file already
        exists and is not “application/json”. If successful, a table containing
        lookup information for the resulting file is returned. If an error occurs,
        the first return value is <em>nil</em>, and the second return value is an error
        message string.
    </p>
    <h3 class="western">readjson(path) – read JSON from a file and deserialize
      it to a Lua value or table</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        This operation reads the file at the
      specified file path, which must be of type, “application/json”. It
      deserializes the JSON and returns it as an equivalent Lua value or table.
      If an error occurs, the first return value is <em>nil</em>, and the
          second return value is an error message string.
    </p>
    <h2 class="western">File Attribute Operations</h2>
    <p>
        FSChoice supports extended file metadata in the form of <em>file
        attributes</em>.
        A file attribute definition specifies a type and description of an
        attribute, and is itself a file. Attribute values are assigned to
        other files by specifying the file path of the attribute definition
        file, and a value which is consistent with the attribute type
        contained in the definition. The supported attribute types are:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        <strong>string</strong> – the attribute value is a string, currently limited to 512 characters<br>
        <strong>number</strong> – a numerical value<br>
        <strong>boolean</strong> – a boolean value<br>
        <strong>json</strong> – a JSON-encoded value<br>
        <strong>file</strong> – a file path
    </p>
    <p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
      The following operations are included in the Lua attrlib module.
    </p>
    <h3 class="western">define(path, type, description) – define a new attribute</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        This operation creates a new attribute
        definition if no file exists at the specified file path. The attribute has
        the given attribute type and description. If a file already exists at the
        file path, it must be an attribute definition with the same type as the
        specified type. The return value is lookup information for the attribute
        definition file. If
        an error occurs, the first return value is <em>nil</em>, and the
        second return value is an error message string.
    </p>
    <h3 class="western">get(path [, …]) – get all or a specified subset of
      attribute values for a file</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        This operation fetches attribute values
        assigned to a file, given by its file path. If only the file path is
        specified, all attribute values associated with the file are returned. Any
        arguments following <em>path</em> are
        interpreted as referencing attribute definitions for which the
        attribute values are desired. If successful, the result is an
        array-like table containing a table for each attribute value. An
        attribute value table contains these fields:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        <strong>name</strong> – the name
        or file path of the attribute definition (attribute definitions
        stored in /System/Attributes may be referenced by just their name)<br>
        <strong>id</strong> – the file id of the attribute definition file<br>
        <strong>type</strong> – the attribute type as specified by its definition<br>
        <strong>value</strong> – the current value of the attribute for the specified file<br>
        <strong>lastset</strong> – the timestamp of when the attribute value was last set on the file<br>
        <strong>setter</strong> – the file path to the user who last set the attribute value on the file
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        If an error occurs, the first return value is <i>nil</i>,
        and the second return value is an error message string.
    </p>

    <h3 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid">set(path, …) – set attribute values on a file</h3>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        This operation sets file attribute values on
        a specified file. The arguments following <i>path</i> specify attribute
        name/value pairs, which may take the form of a name argument followed
        by a value argument, or a table argument containing the fields <b>name</b> and <b>value</b>,
        or an array-like table argument containing the attribute name as the
        first element, and the attribute value as the second element. These
        forms can be mixed in an argument list. An attribute name will
        generally be the full path to the attribute definition file, unless
        the definition is in /System/Attributes. An attribute value must be
        consistent with the attribute type specified in the attribute
        definition, though some implicit conversions are supported. For
        example, a number can be specified for a boolean value, with zero
        being interpreted as <i>false</i> and all
        other values <i>true</i>.
        Setting an attribute to an empty value, e.g. <i>nil</i>, results
        in that attribute being removed from the file.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        The result is an array-like table
        containing a table entry for each set attribute. Each entry is
        similar to the table entries returned by <i>get()</i>, but may
        have an <b>error</b>
        field with an error message string if
        there was a problem setting a particular value. If some more global
        error occurs, the first return value is <i>nil</i>, and the
        second return value is an error message string.
    </p>

    <h2 class="western">User/Group/Session Operations</h2>
    <p>
        These operations are included in the Lua userlib module.
    </p>
    <h3 class="western">getsession() – get session information for the current
      session, creating one if necessary</h3>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        This operation returns information about the
        current session, creating a session if one does not exist. If successful
        (and it generally should be), it returns a table containing the following
        fields:
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        <b>sessionid</b> – a unique id assigned to this session (actually the file id of the
        choice/session file)<br>
        <b>cgid</b> – the current group id, which is the group containing the current user<br>
        <b>logingroup</b> – the file path to the current login group, which is obtained from components used
        to resolve an HTML request<br>
        <b>user</b> – a table containing information about the current user, with fields:
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.58in">
        <b>name</b> – the username (without the group path) (“guest” if the user is not logged in)<br>
        <b>id</b> – the file id of the current user<br>
        <b>path</b> – the full file path of the current user (“/System/Users/guest” if not logged in)
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        <b>home</b> – the home page associated with the current group (if any)<br>
        <b>groups</b> – an array-like table containing a table for each group to which the current user belongs
        (directly). Each group entry table contains:
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.58in">
        <b>gid</b> – the group id (the file id of the user group file)<br>
        <b>name</b> – the simple name of the group<br>
        <b>desc</b> – the group description, if any<br>
        <b>member</b> – the username of the current user in the group (the same user may have different usernames in
        different groups)<br>
        <b>paths</b> – an array-like table containing all the file paths for the group<br>
        <b>roles</b> – if the user is a
        system administrator, an array-like table with one entry: “ADMIN”
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        If an error occurs, the first return value is <i>nil</i>,
        and the second return value is an error message string.
    </p>

    <h3 class="western">getlogingroup() – get the current login group for this session</h3>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        This operation returns the file path of the
        current login group. The current login group is determined by the last
        access to an HTML file that was resolved by a component which specified a
        user group. If an error occurs, the first return value is <i>nil</i>,
        and the second return value is an error message string.
    </p>

    <h3 class="western">isloggedin() – check whether a user is currently logged in on the current session</h3>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        Return a boolean indicating whether a user is
        currently logged in on the current session. If an
        error occurs, the first return value is <i>nil</i>, and the
        second return value is an error message string.
    </p>

    <h3 class="western">login(username, password [, group|gid]) – login a user on the current session</h3>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        Login a specified user. The group containing
        the given username can be specified using the file path of the user group
        file, or the group id. If the group is not specified, the current login
        group is assumed. If a user is already logged in (even the same user),
        that user is logged out before the login is processed. If successful, the
        result is a table containing these fields:
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        <b>status</b> – a value of 1<br>
        <b>role</b> – an array-like table containing “ADMIN” if the user is a system administrator<br>
        <b>redirect</b> – the home page, if any, for the user group containing the user
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        If an error occurs, the first return value is <i>nil</i>,
        and the second return value is an error message string.
    </p>

    <h3 class="western">logout() – log out of the current session</h3>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        This operation performs a logout operation
        for the current session, if a user is logged in, returning <i>true</i> if successful. If a user is not currently
        logged in, or some other error occurs, <i>false</i> is returned.
    </p>

    <h3 class="western">checkuser(username [, password [, group|gid]) – check a username and password</h3>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        This operation checks the validity of a
        username, and optionally a password. It is generally used during user
        registration to determine if a username has valid syntax and has not been
        assigned already. The username is evaluated against a group that can be
        specified by user group file path or file id, or else the current login
        group is assumed. If the password is specified, its validity will also be
        checked. Two result values are returned. The first value is a numeric code
        with the following meanings:
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        <b>-1</b> – an error occurred<br>
        <b>0</b> – the username (and password if present) is valid and not currently assigned in the group<br>
        <b>1</b> – the username exists in the group and the password is valid<br>
        <b>2</b> – the username exists in the group, but the password is invalid
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in; font-weight: normal">
        The second return value
        is a string, which is either an error message or an interpretation of the
        numeric code.
    </p>

    <h3 class="western">canregister([group|gid]) – check whether registration is enabled</h3>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        This operation checks whether registration is
        enabled for the indicated group, if specified, or else for the current
        login group. If successful, it returns a table containing:
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        <b>status</b> – <i>true</i> if registration
        is enabled for the group (or if no users have been registered in the
        system yet, in which case the first user registered becomes a system
        administrator<br>
        <b>captcha</b> – <i>true</i> if the group settings indicate that a
        captcha should be used when registering users for the group
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        If an error occurs, the first return value is
        <i>nil</i>, and the second return value is an error message string.
    </p>

    <h3 class="western">mkuser(group, username, [password], [email], [regcode]) – create a new user</h3>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
        This operation creates a new user in the
        specified group, given by its user group file path. If the password is not
        specified, it defaults to an empty string. An email address and

        string or an integer. This operation does not check whether registration
        is enabled for the group, or whether the username is valid. However, it
        will fail if the username already exists in the group. If successful, a
        table containing file lookup information for the created user is returned.
        If an error occurs, the first return value is <i>nil</i>, and the second
        return value is an error message string.
